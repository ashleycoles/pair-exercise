        <div class="product-desc">Let It Be is the twelfth and final studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost a month after the group's break-up, in tandem with the documentary of the same name. Concerned about recent friction within the band, Paul McCartney had conceived the project as an attempt to reinvigorate the group by returning to simpler rock 'n' roll configurations. The album topped charts in many countries, including both the US and the UK, but the critical response was generally unfavourable, and Let It Be came to be regarded as one of the most controversial rock albums in history.</div>
